### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Julien Roy, I have a bachelor in biomedical engineering and I am currently pursuing my PhD in Reinforcement Learning at Mila. I'm interested in real-life applications of modern RL/DL techniques with a special interest in applications to Life Sciences (drug discovery, genomics, etc.).
